# Movies

Will not run after importing and can't put the API keys because of GitHub Terms and conditions. Let me know if you guys need them.

Sample Android app that shows the latest movies in theaters, it can order them by popularity or by rating. It uses Retrofit, Fabric, Picasso, RecyclerViews, GSON, Crashlytics, Support Annotations, ButterKnife, Design library, CardViews, Espresso, JUnit, Hamcrest, LeakCanary.
It consumes the Open Movie Database, creates animations between screens, GridLayout in a RecyclerView, used the CoordinatorLayout to hide the Toolbar every time the user scrolls.

There is a lot to do still, but this would give you a small sneak peak of what I'm working on right now.
