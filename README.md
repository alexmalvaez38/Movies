# Movies

Will not run after importing and can't put the API keys because of GitHub Terms and conditions. Let me know if you guys need them.

Sample Android app that shows the latest movies in theathers, it can order them by popularity or by rating. It uses Retrofyt, Fabric, Picasso, RecyclerViews, GSON, Crashlytics, Support Annotations, ButterKnife, Design library, CardViews, Espresso, JUnit, Hamcrest, LeakCanary.
It consumes the Open Movie Database, creates animations between screens, GridLayout in a RecyclerView, used the CoordinatorLayout to hide the Toolbar everytime the user scrolls.

There is a lot to do still and I wanted to open source it when it was ready, but this would give you a small sneak peak of what I'm working on right now.
